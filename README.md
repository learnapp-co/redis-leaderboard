# Leaderboard App

A simple web application that displays a leaderboard of players with their scores. It allows fetching and displaying the leaderboard, showing the total number of players, and highlights the top player based on their score.

## Features

- Displays a leaderboard of players with their scores.
- Shows the **total number of players**.
- Highlights the **top player** with the highest score.
- Automatically updates the leaderboard when data is fetched from the backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (assuming you have an API with the endpoints `/leaderboard/list`, `/leaderboard/total`, `/leaderboard/top`)
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios for making API calls

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or `yarn` if you prefer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaderboard-app.git

### Notes:
1. Replace `https://github.com/your-username/leaderboard-app.git` with your actual repository URL.
2. Ensure the API endpoints match the actual API structure and data you're working with. Adjust the URL `http://10.0.7.210:9000` as per your backend setup if needed.
3. If you have a backend running locally, ensure it's properly set up to respond with the correct data format.
